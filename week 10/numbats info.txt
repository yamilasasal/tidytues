Week 10 Numbats

Numbats in Australia

The data this week comes from the Atlas of Living Australia. Thanks to Di cook for preparing this week's dataset!

This Numbat page at the Atlas of Living Australia talks about these endangered species in greater detail.

A csv file of numbat sightings is provided. The code to refresh the data is below.

Questions that would be interesting to answer are:

    Where do you find numbats in Australia?
    Was the distribution more widespread historically? (You may need to exclude zoo reported observations.)
    What time of day do numbat sightings occur?
    Are they more frequent in the summer or winter?
    Are numbats seen more on sunny and warm days than cloudy, wet, cold days?
    Do sightings happen more on week days than weekends?
